            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p>
              I created a responsive, mobile-first website using bootstrap.
              Users have found it very easy to navigate the site and complete
              scenario-based tasks in the latest iteration of the portfolio.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">My Role:</h3>
            <p>
              I was solely responsible for all stages of the development process
              from initial secondary research to the creation of the final
              website and visuals.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Challenges overcome:</h3>
            <p>
              As a personal project undertaken during a global pandemic, with
              zero budget, the main challenge I faced was to research the user
              requirements without having the means to visit Hiring mangers and
              UX professionals for interviews/contextual enquiries.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Process:</h3>
            <p>
              I followed a design thinking process in designing the portfolio,
              with the clear distinct stages 'Empathise', 'Define', 'Ideate',
              'Prototype' and 'Test'. This was an iterative process, but for
              clarity I've displayed the content under the process headings in
              this case study.

          <div class="col-12">
            <p>
              The function of the portfolio is straightforward, focusing on a
              few tasks, so I felt that considering each manager's content as an
              'interview' should show any behaviour patterns or common
              requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided on a baseline of 5 'interviews', if I hadn't seen a
              clear pattern then I'd undertake further research or may have
              needed to rethink my strategy… fortunately I found that the
              requirements and responses were very similar among the 5
              'interviewees'.
            </p>
            <p>
              A little secondary research lead to a vast amount of content that
              answered any questions I had about the user requirements and
              revealed that:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                UX hiring managers want case studies to
                <strong>tell a story</strong> - design is about storytelling.
              </li>
              <li>
                A portfolio should contain 2-3 case studies of my
                <strong>best</strong> and <strong>varied</strong> work.
              </li>
              <li>
                My portfolio should
                <strong>display my personality</strong> and be informally, but
                professionally, written to stand out.
              </li>
              <li>
                UX hiring managers feel that
                <strong>how the portfolio is constructed</strong> will reflect a
                lot about me as a designer - no room for sloppiness!

                when building your portfolio, especially if face-to-face
                interviews aren't feasible!

                    The idea was to employ a card-based design from the
                    beginning, but I felt this initial very minimal layout was
                    too sparse for a portfolio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also considered a very trendy dark mode, but felt that
                    this works best when you want the images to take centre
                    stage and better suited for a photographer's portfolio, mine
                    is content-driven.

                    I considered an alternative design with a section for each
                    project that would take up the width of the screen, but
                    realised that users would need to scroll through to view
                    each project and a card-based layout would provide users
                    with an instant overview of my work.

                  <p>
                    In this design the same bottom tab bar is used for
                    navigation on mobile and more conventional navigation on
                    desktop with prominent 'call-to-action' buttons.

                    I considered leaving a column on the left for titles and
                    headers at larger screen sizes, but felt that smaller
                    sections may look a little cluttered.

                  <p>
                    Also I felt that I'd lose the visual hierarchy and the

                    the most of the whole screen.

                    This is closer to the final design of prototype 1. Content
                    is generally contained in 2 centred columns on larger
                    devices, but allows for hero images/detailed content to make
                    the most of screen space on desktop without losing the

                in some circumstances, but of course I had to rely on them
                'practicing what they preach'. There is no substitute for
                contextual enquiry in the actual environment where the product
                is used to gain any real insight, but given the circumstances I
                could find more information about the hiring managers' portfolio
                requirements than I originally feared.

                test that the flow makes sense to the user, before later
                adopting a high fidelity prototype of the almost complete
                product design to carry out scenario-based user testing.

                Based on the research findings it was important to keep the
                portfolio content-driven. When making design decisions I needed
                remember that
                <strong>I am not the target user</strong> &ndash; hiring
                managers won't thank me for being too original in my portfolio
                design if it makes it more difficult to find the relevant
                information.

                The bottom tab bar mobile pattern is good to adopt for ease of
                use on larger mobile devices, but
                <strong>only when it aligns with users' expectations.</strong>
                Need to be mindful that some users may not expect the navigation
                of a webpage to be at the bottom.
