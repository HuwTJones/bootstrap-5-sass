                It is possible to order hygiene bags at the end of the request

                from the the initial 'order bins and bags' screen, so users may
                have already, unnecessarily, completed the hygiene bag request
                form - this means they have to enter the same name, address and

              As well as issues with user flow I also wanted to highlight any
              specific usability issues and obstacles that may have made my
              experience frustrating enough to build an alternative prototype!

            <p>
              Ideally an analysis should be undertaken by a team of 3 to 5
              designers and their findings cross-referenced, but the reality is
              that this is a personal project with no budget so 1 will have to
              do!
            </p>
            <p>
              I felt that the narrow scope of the evaluation (purely concerned
              with the request form usability) meant that I should be able to
              identify enough of the main pain points on my own to improve the
              user experience.

                  Secondary research can provide a wealth of information about
                  the user</strong

                in some circumstances, but of course I had to rely on them
                'practicing what they preach'. There is no substitute for
                contextual enquiry in the actual environment where the product
                is used to gain any real insight, but given the circumstances I
                could find more information about the hiring managers' portfolio
                requirements than I originally feared.

                test that the flow makes sense to the user, before later
                adopting a high fidelity prototype of the almost complete
                product design to carry out scenario-based user testing.

                Based on the research findings it was important to keep the
                portfolio content-driven. When making design decisions I needed
                remember that
                <strong>I am not the target user</strong> &ndash; hiring
                managers won't thank me for being too original in my portfolio
                design if it makes it more difficult to find the relevant
                information.

                The bottom tab bar mobile pattern is good to adopt for ease of
                use on larger mobile devices, but
                <strong>only when it aligns with users' expectations.</strong>
                Need to be mindful that some users may not expect the navigation
                of a webpage to be at the bottom.
