            <ul>
              <li>
                There is no access to the top-level menu for the site once a
                user request has been cancelled for any of the 3 tasks.
              </li>
              <li>
                The same details are requested on numerous occasions during the
                process.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is possible to order hygiene bags at the end of the request
                for a full set of bins to a new property, but this isn't clear
                from the the initial 'order bins and bags' screen. Users may
                have already (unnecessarily) completed the hygiene bag request
                form and have to enter the same name, address and personal
                details at least twice!
              </li>
              <li>
                New property owners are informed that they will receive a full
                set of bins once payment is received, but only once they have
                entered their details and made a bin request - this would be
                very frustrating for users who are not responsible for
                purchasing the bins.

              As well as issues with user flow, I also wanted to highlight any
              specific usability concerns and obstacles that may have made my
              experience frustrating enough to build an alternative prototype!
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally an analysis should be undertaken by a team of 3 to 5
              designers and their findings cross-referenced, but the reality is
              that this is a personal project with no budget so 1 will have to
              do!
            </p>
            <p>
              I felt that the narrow scope of the evaluation (purely concerned
              with the request form usability) meant that I should be able to
              identify enough of the main pain points on my own to improve the
              user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an attempt to avoid personal bias I used Jakob Nielsen et.
              al's 10 usability principles as a framework for the analysis.

              The main roadblocks and areas of friction my evaluation found were
              as follows (this is not a comprehensive report of the evaluation
              findings):

                exactly the same actions. Neither buttons contain a forward

              One of my main objectives was to increase the efficiency of the
              ordering process, which should mean that the tasks take less time
              to perform, so I set users a specific scenario and measured the
              time taken to complete the task.
            </p>

            <p>The average completion times are shown below:</p>

            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I found it really <strong>cathartic and rewarding</strong> to
                redesign a frustrating user experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                It's very pleasing and a confidence boost to see such clear
                evidence of a design improving the user experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                By sticking to the aesthetics and components of the existing
                site (not designing a 'rockstar' replacement) I feel I gained an
                <strong>insight into the real-world design issues</strong> the
                council website faced. My empathy with the designers/developers
                also increased as a lot of the issues will no doubt be caused by
                the limitations of 3rd party systems!
              </li>
              <li>
                It's beneficial to base design decisions on
                <strong>quantitative</strong> and
                <strong>qualitative</strong> data (completion times and user
                feedback in this case).
              </li>
              <li>
                The process of replicating input element interactions in Figma
                was <strong>more time-consuming</strong> than I'd hoped. If the
                components I've already built for this study can't be easily
                repurposed in similar future studies, then I may just
                <strong>build a dummy contact form</strong> in Bootstrap etc.
